# Implementation of a True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to write an implementation of a TRNG, using sources of natural origin, _id est_ pictures of the Sun from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and radio feeds from around the world.
## Features
- Uses real-world entropy sources
- Supports random *Raw Data* generation
## Entropy sources
- Images of the Sun captured by SOHO in different spectral filters
- Radio channel data from different radios around the world
## Algorithm
The algorithm uses two main seeds and a secondary one to generate random raw data.
