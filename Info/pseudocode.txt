n: 128b   2048b
    16B    256B

fetch images when app is ran
for each image in images
    get data and xor between certain bytes (to do: figure out algorithm, specific for each n-number to generate)

number - number in current state, only from applying xor-operations etc. on images
(idea:
    for each photo, get a byte of data from the photo by skipping with a step of n/16 bits / n/2 B
    then xor the first byte from every photo with the first byte from the other photos and so on
    then concatenate the bytes generated
)
rot number by a step of n/4 B

# generate seed:
sys_entropy = number generated from system params
seed = sha256(sys_entropy)

based on size of n:
seed resize = an equal amount of bytes as n

seed rot (n/2 B)

number first Byte xor seed Last byte and so on

result: random number
